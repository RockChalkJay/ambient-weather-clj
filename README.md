(aw/user-devices "your-app-key" "your-api-key")
</code></pre>

#### Get historical device data

<pre><code>(require '[ambient-weather-clj :as aw])

(def query {:app-key "your-app-key"
            :api-key "your-api-key"
            :mac-addr "BB:AA:CC:DD:11:00"
            :date "2020-08-21T03:52:00.000Z"
            :limit 5}

(aw/device-data query)
</code></pre>

### Realtime Data

Create a connected socket and add event listners

<pre><code>(require '[ambient-weather-clj :as aw])

(def event-listners {:subscribed   (fn [& args]
                                     (println (apply str args)))
                     :unsubscribed (fn [& args]
                                     (println (apply str args)))
                     :data         (fn [& args]
                                     (println (apply str args)))})

(def socket (aw/socket "your-app-key" event-listners)
